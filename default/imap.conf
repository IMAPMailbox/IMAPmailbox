# IMAP connection and indexing configuration
#
# This file provides configures how the Splunk IMAP application connects to
# the IMAP server, what email it downloads and how it gets indexed.
#

[IMAP Configuration]

# ===================================
# Required Settings
# ===================================

#
# server
#
# The host name or IP address of the IMAP server that will provide the 
# mail to be indexed.
#
server = YOUR_SERVER_HERE

#
# user
#
# Username on the IMAP server
#
user = YOUR_USER_NAME_HERE

#
# xpassword
#
# User's password for the IMAP server in encrypted text.
#
# To get an encrypted version of you password, run the bin/genpass.sh script 
# Copy and paste its encrypted password output as the value here. 
#
xpassword =

#
# password
#
# User's password for the IMAP server in plaintext.
#
# WARNING: placing plaintext passwords in a configuration file is a significant 
# security risk.  It is recommended that you leave this setting blank and
# instead use the xpassword setting above.
#
password = 


# ===================================
# Optional Settings
# ===================================

#
# useSSL
#
# If true will use SSL for the IMAP server connection. Make sure port setting below is set correctly
#
useSSL = true

#
# port
#
# IMAP server port.  You only need to change this if your server is running
# on a non-standard port.
#
port = 993

#
# fullHeaders
#
# If True, all headers will be indexed.  If False, only to, from, subject,
# date, size, mbox, and cc will be indexed.  Setting this to true will
# increase the size of the splunk database.
#
fullHeaders = False

#
# includeBody
#
# If True, each message body will be indexed.  In the case of multipart 
# messages, indexing will occur on all parts whose content type is in the
# mimeTypes list (see below).  If you don't need to search message bodies
# in Splunk, setting this to False can reduce database size and increase 
# performance.
#
includeBody = True

#
# mimeTypes
#
# Comma-separated list mime types to be indexed.(no spaces!)  When a multipart 
# message is encountered, only parts of a type found in this list
# will be indexed.
#
# This settings has no effect if includeBody is False.
#
# mimeTypes = text/plain,text/html,text/richtext
mimeTypes = text/plain

#
# folders
#
# A comma-separated list of folders to be indexed, e.g. 
#
#   INBOX.bugs, INBOX.support, INBOX.checkins
#
# If you wish to index everything, set this value to "all".   If folder is 
# blank, then the default (typically 'INBOX') will be used.  
#
folders = all

#
# imapSearch 
#
# Provides an IMAP4 search expression that is used to query
# for messages to be retrieved from the IMAP server for indexing.
#
# The default imapSearch will find all undeleted messages on the server
# which are smaller than 200k.  You can modify this value to further
# narrow the set of messages that will be retrieved.
#
# For example, the following imapSearch will retrieve all undeleted 
# messages smaller than 200k that were sent by erik@splunk.com since 
# Feburary 1997:
#
#   UNDELETED SMALLER 204800 FROM "erik@splunk.com" SINCE 1-Feb-1997
#
# As another example, the following imapSearch will retrieve 
# all undeleted messages with the word 'chocolate' in the body and the word
# 'cake' or 'ice cream' in the subject:
#
#   UNDELETED BODY "chocolate" (OR SUBJECT "cake" SUBJECT "ice cream")
#
#
# A complete description of search strings can be found in section 6.4.4 
# of the IMAP specification:
#
#   http://www.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc3501.txt
#
imapSearch = UNDELETED

#
# deleteWhenDone
#
# If true will delete messages from mailbox after indexing.
# Should note that deteleWhenDone overrides any caching and assumes that each time 
# the script gets called all messages in the inbox are new.
#
# I have noticed if you do not delete mail. Checking for mail can get extremely slow.
#
deleteWhenDone = True

# 
# debug
#
# If true, extra processing info will be output (and indexed).  You
# generally won't want to set this to True.
#
debug = False

#
# noCache
#
# If true, the 'read message' cache will be ignored.  This effectively causes 
# all matching messages to be retrieved and indexed repeatedly; you probably 
# don't want to set this to True.
#
#
noCache = False 

#If caching is turned on, we need to retrieve the latest UID from the splunk servers
#This is the userid for a default splunk installation. Change it to whatever user account
#you have set up if you have a custom installation.
splunkuser = admin

#If caching is turned on, we need to retrieve the latest UID from the splunk servers
#This is the password for the default splunk installation. Change it appropriately if you have set
#it up differently.
splunkpassword = changeme

#This is the encrypted password for the splunk installation. Change it appropriately if you have set
#it up differently.
splunkxpassword = 

#Path to the splunk host path. If yours is different from the default change this to
#https://<hostname>:<port>
splunkHostPath = https://localhost:8089
